        <p>Jennifer passed away unexpectedly on April 9, 2024. She was living with her fiancé and their two young toddlers, a 2-year-old boy and a 1-year-old girl.</p>
        <p>Jennifer was known for her high energy and fearless attitude. Her passion for sports began early. She was a vibrant individual known for her athleticism and adventurous spirit. She enjoyed skiing, snowboarding, biking (including a memorable ride down Haleakalā volcano in Maui with her dad), swimming, snorkeling, canoeing, camping, and hiking. At 15, she started swimming competitively for the Clearwater Aquatics team in Clearwater, Florida, where she was quite successful placing and winning races in tournaments.</p>
        <p>Each summer as a young girl, she would vacation with the family at a lake in CA. She would watch her uncles swim a mile across a cold mountain lake. Once she started swimming competitively, she decided she wanted to do that difficult swim. The next summer, she accomplished that feat to the surprise of all the relatives.</p>
        <p>Her favorite summer job was as a swimming instructor for children. She was continually amazed at how they could learn to swim even before walking and was thrilled to help children in that way. It gave her so much joy!</p>
        <p>She also loved cooking and enjoyed eating healthy food.</p>
        <p>Becoming a mother was a highlight of her life. This brought her immense joy, a feeling she frequently conveyed to her own mother, expressing her love and fulfillment in the role of motherhood.</p>
        <p>Jennifer is survived by her parents, her brother, her two children, her fiancé (the children’s father), her uncles and their partners, and a large number of other family and friends.</p>
        <p>A celebration of life memorial is being planned for mid-summer.</p>
        <p>In lieu of flowers, donations for the family are being accepted. Please see the <a href="http://ffnd.co/n/j2fHxQ/50975">link</a> below for more details about the family, pictures of the children, or to contribute.</p>
